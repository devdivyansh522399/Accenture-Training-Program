Looping Statement:

1. for
2. while



for loop

for iterator in list:
	statement(s)


e.g.

for value in [11,22,33,44,55]:
	print(value)



Program: Write a program to print all even elements of the following list:

for value in [54,89,12,90,43,65,100]:
	if(value%2==0):
		print(value)



Program: Write a program to print all numbers which are divisible 3 from 1 to 100.



#Generating Lists in Python

range(start=0,stop,step=1) : Generates/Returns a list of numbers from start to stop-1.

e.g.

range(1,11)   		#[1,2,3,...,10]
range(2,21,2)		#[2,4,6,...,20]
range(100,0,-1)		#[100,99,98,...,1]
range(10)			#[0,1,2,..,9]



for i in range(1,101,1):
	if(i%3==0):
		print(i)

or

for i in range(3,101,3):
	print(i)




#Sum

sum=0
for value of lst:
	sum=sum+value


#Count

count=0
for value of lst:
	count=count+1


Program: Write a program to calculate sum of all elements whose value is greater than 50. Also count the total no. occurences of the such elements.




lst=[43,23,65,12,90,23,80,34,59,82]

count=0
sum=0
for value in lst:
	if(value>50):
		sum=sum+value
		count=count+1

print("Sum = ", sum)
print("Count = ", count)



while Loop


Sometimes, loop control may need to be based on the value of what we are processing. In this case, we would sentinel-controlled repetition. Sentinel-controlled repetition is sometimes called indefinite repetition because it is not known in advance how many times the loop will be executed. It is a repetition procedure for solving a problem by using a sentinel value (also called a signal value, a dummy value or a flag value) to indicate "end of data entry". The sentinel value itself is not a part of the processed data.

An example of when we would use sentinel-controlled repetition is when we are processing data from a file and we do not know in advance when we would reach the end of the file.	


Syntax:

initialization
while(condition):
	statement(s)
	updation

i=1
while(i<=10):
	print(i)
	i+=1

or


while(condition):
	statement(s)


e.g.

while(n>0):			
	n=n//10




#Mini App


while(True):
	print("1. Add")
	print("2. Subtract")
	print("3. Multiply")
	print("4. Divide")
	print("0. Exit")

	choice=int(input("Enter Your Choice : "))

	if(choice==1):
		a=int(input("Enter First Number : "))
		b=int(input("Enter Second Number : "))
		c=a+b
		print("Sum : ", c)
	elif(choice==2):
		a=int(input("Enter First Number : "))
		b=int(input("Enter Second Number : "))
		c=a-b
		print("Subtract : ", c)
	elif(choice==0):
		exit(0)
	else:
		print("Invalid Choice : ")
 





1. Write a program to print all factors of a given no.

E.g.

Input
24

Output
1 2 3 4 6 8 12 24


n=int(input("Enter a Number : "))
for i in range(1,n+1):
	if(n%i==0):
		print(i)


Write a program to count all factorial of a no.

Input
24
Output
8


count=0
n=int(input("Enter A Number : "))
for i in range(1,n+1):
	if(n%i==0):
		count=count+1
print(count)
	

Write a program to check if a number is prime no. or not. (hint: Prime no. 2 has two factors only)

count=0
n=int(input("Enter A Number : "))
for i in range(1,n+1):
	if(n%i==0):
		count=count+1

if(count==2):
	print("Prime Number")
else:
	print("Not a Prime Number")
