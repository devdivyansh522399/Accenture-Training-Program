The marks obtained by a student in 5 different subjects are input by the user. The student gets a division as per the following rules:

Percentage above or equal to 60 - First division

Write a program to calculate the division obtained by the student.


Write a program to accept rank and basic salary of an employee and calculate net salary on the basis of following criterians:

	rank 			hra 		da 			pf
	1				90%			60%         12%
	2 				70% 		40% 		12%
	3 				50%			30% 		12%
	-				1200		20% 		-


Net Salary = Basic Salary + HRA + DA - PF



------------------------------------

basic=float(input("Enter Basic Salary : "))
rank=int(input("Enter Rank : "))

if(rank==1):
	hra=basic*.90
	da=basic*.60
	pf=basic*.12
elif(rank==2):
	hra=basic*.70
	da=basic*.40
	pf=basic*.12
elif(rank==3):
	hra=basic*.50
	da=basic*.30
	pf=basic*.12
else:
	hra=1200
	da=basic*.20
	pf=0

net=basic+hra+da-pf
print("Net Salary : ", net)




Write a program to calculate the monthly telephone bills as per the following rule:

Minimum Rs. 200 for upto 100 calls.

Plus Rs. 0.50 per call for next 50 calls. 
Plus Rs. 0.40 per call for any call beyond 200 calls.




Shorthand if.else


if(a%2==0):
	print("Even")
else:
	print("Odd")


print("Even" if(a%2==0) else "Odd")


Syntax:


statement-X if(condition) else statement-Y

statement-X will execute if condition is true, otherwise statement-Y will be executed



In a company an employee is paid as under: 

If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary.

If his salary is either equal to or above Rs. 1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. 

If the employee's salary is input by the user write a program to find his gross salary.


basic=float(input('Enter Basic Salary : '))

hra=basic*.10 if(basic<1500) else 500
da=basic*.90 if(basic<1500) else basic*.98

net=basic+hra+da

print(net)
